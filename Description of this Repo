I took MIS 3306 from my university, which utilized Microsoft Visio in constructing entity-relationship models and MySQL for data retrievals.

I wanted to share the exercises we did that utilized these programs and showcase my understanding of it through set of problems.

Just wanted to show this out there, for I found these interesting to work with and useful to know.

These are meant to serve as a guide and showcase my learning experience within the course :)


Note:
I am mainly using Microsoft Visio and sometimes Draw.io to draw the diagrams. I primarily use the IE (crowâ€™s foot) notation. 
The diagrams should show entities, keys, attributes, and maximum numbers on each side. 
I uploaded the type of problems we are solving and the individual diagram separately.
