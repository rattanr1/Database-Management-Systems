I took MIS 3306 from my university, which utilized Microsoft Visio in constructing entity-relationship models and MySQL for data retrievals.

I wanted to share the exercises we did that utilized these programs and showcase my understanding of it through set of problems.

Just wanted to show this out there, for I found these interesting to work with and useful to know.

These are meant to serve as a guide and showcase my learning experience within the course :)
